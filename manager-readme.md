# Manager README

## My Goal
As a Director of Enginering at Kapost, my job is to

- Build good relationship with each member of my team(s)
- Provide context and priority
- Remove roadblocks so that you can do your best work

I work to build deep, trusting relationships with the members of my team.  I care about you as a person just as much as I care about the work you're producing.  

I try to never micro-manage by telling you what to do, or how to do it.  I'm happy to share my opinions, but I default to asking questions to help guide your thinking.  I've heard it said that people need to hear things up to 7 times before they will truely undertand what is being said.  So, you'll probably hear me repeating things.  This is my attempt to share context and priority instead of micro-manage.

If something is blocking you from doing your best work, please tell me.  If I can do something to help you do your best work, please tell me.  If you don't like the work you're doing, please tell me.  I can't fix what I don't know.  

## What I Value
**Honesty** - I will be honest with you, and I expect the same.  Dishonestly will quickly erode our trust.

**Humility** - We are all smart, but there is always something more we can learn _from those around us_.

**Kindness** - As Rands says, ["Be Unfailingly Kind"](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/be-unfailingly-kind/).

## Availability
My schedule is typically busy, but I will always make time to talk.

All I need is your best 40 hours. I don't want any more than that. When you are not working, enjoy your life outside of work. This includes taking vacations and days off frequently.

## One-on-ones (1:1)
I like to have weekly 1:1s that are at least 30 minutes long.  1:1s are the most important thing I do each week.  I will never cancel and rarely reschedule our 1:1, unless one of us is out for the week.

I will setup our 1:1 on the calendar so that you can modify it.  If you need to move it to a time that's better for you, please do.

I prefer 1:1s to be driven by you.  Come prepared to talk about the things that are most important to you.  I like it when the topics aren't status updates (we have Jira, standups, etc. for that), but will happily talk about status if that's what you want to talk about.  Instead, I really like to talk about the deeper stuff - the stuff you'd be afraid to say if you knew others were listening.

My goal in 1:1s is to collect as much signal as I can.  I approach this by asking a lot of questions.  I then process all the signals and look for the most important thing I can work on changing.

## Feedback
Feedback is a huge part of growing, as an individual as well as a professional.  I will seek to give you timely feedback, and have found the [situation-behavior-impact](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/give-humble-feedback/) model to be very effective.

Acting on every bit of feedback you receive isn't necessary.  Instead process it, and decide for yourself when and how to implement changes.  If I think feedback needs to be acted on immediately, I will tell you.

## Performance
My goal is that we are always on the same page regarding your performance.  If you feel unsure, please ask!

I work on a green/orange/red system.  If I haven't told you otherwise, you are in the green.

**Green** - You're doing good, great, exceptional. There still might be areas of improvement, but you're getting the job done and working well with your team.

**Orange** - There are one or more things that, if not improved, are unsustainable.

**Red** - There is a significant problem that won't be tollerated for much longer. You need to identify a series of steps, and a timeframe, to get it fixed. We will talk about and agree on both of these, in writing, and will likely involve HR in the process.

## What Frustrates Me
I have a strong bias towards action.  I'm happy to brainstorm ideas and solutions, but at some point I will get frustrated if we don't pick a path forward and try it.  I think the best way to learn is to try, and the best way to imporove is through small steps.

Speaking poorly about others.  We all have bad days; we all have a story that has shaped who we are; we are all imperfect.  We should value each other as human beings and embrace and celebrate our diversity and differences.
