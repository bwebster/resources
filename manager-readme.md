# Manager README

## What I Value
**Honesty** - I will be honest with you, and I expect the same.  Dishonestly will quickly erode our trust.

**Humility** - We are all smart, but there is always something more we can learn _from those around us_.

**Kindness** - As Rands says, [Be Unfailingly Kind](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/be-unfailingly-kind/).

## Availability
My schedule is typically busy, but I will always make time to talk.

All I need is your best 40 hours. I don't want any more than that. When you are not working, enjoy your life outside of work. This includes taking vacations and days off frequently.

## One-on-ones (1:1)
I like to have weekly 1:1s that are at least 30 minutes long.  1:1s are the most important thing I do each week.  I will never cancel, and rarely reschedule our 1:1, unless we are both out on a given week.

I prefer 1:1s to be driven by you.  Come prepared to talk about the things that are most important to you.  I like it when the topics aren't status updates (we have Jira for that), but will happily talk about status if that's what you want to talk about.  Instead, I really like to talk about the deeper stuff - the stuff you'd be afraid to say if you knew others were listening.

## Feedback
Feedback is a huge part of growing, as an individual as well as a professional.  I will seek to give you timely feedback throughout the week, and save the bigger conversations for 1:1s.

Acting on every bit of feedback you receive isn't necessary.  Instead process it, and decide for yourself when and how to implement changes.  If I think feedback needs to be acted on immediately, I will tell you.

## Performance
My goal is that we are always on the same page regarding your performance.  If you feel unsure, please ask!

I work on a green/orange/red system.  If I haven't told you otherwise, you are in the green.

**Green** - You're doing good, great, exceptional. There still might be areas of improvement, but you're getting the job done and working well with your team.

**Orange** - There are one or more things that, if not improved, are unsustainable.

**Red** - There is a significant problem that won't be tollerated for much longer. You need to identify a series of steps, and a timeframe, to get it fixed. We will talk about and agree on both of these.
