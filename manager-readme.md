# Manager README

**(This is a work in progress...)**

So, what is this anyway?  It's my attempt at helping you understand what's important to me, what I expect of you, and the ways I'll be working _for you_.

## My Job

At a minimum my job is to

- Attract, retain and develop amazing engineers like you.
- Provide context

If I do anything that hurts my ability to retain you, please tell me. 

If it ever feels like I'm micromanaging you, or the team, instead of providing context, please tell me.

## How We Work Together

### Availability

While my schedule can be busy, there is nothing that takes precedence over talking to you. If you need to talk, I'll make it happen regardless of my schedule.

I will almost never need to talk with you outside of normal business hours.  While I might send you a Slack message (or @mention you) at odd hours when I'm processing something, you don't need to respond.  If I need an immediate response off-hours, I'll tell you it's `URGENT`.

All I need is your best 40 hours.  I don't want any more than that.  When you are not working, enjoy your life outside of work.  This includes taking vacations and days off frequently.

### One-on-ones (1:1)

I like to have weekly 1:1s that are at least 30 minutes long.  These meetings are the most important thing I do each week.

These meetings are for you.  I like it when you come prepared with things to talk about.

I'll always have something we can talk about if you don't have anything pressing.  I like to run the big things I'm thinking about by you to get your input and feedback.

I'd prefer for these meetings to not be status updates, unless that's what you'd really like to talk about.  

Always feel free to reschedule a 1:1 meeting to any other time within business hours.

### Feedback

In order for each of us to get better, we need to be able to give each other feedback.

I will strive to give timely feedback whenever possible.

Acting on every bit of feedback is not necessary.  Instead, process it and decide for yourself which bits of feedback need action.

Giving difficult feedback is a challenge for me, and something I'm actively working on.  I'm still learning how to to it in a non-awkward fashion.  Feedback on how I'm giving you feedback is greatly appreciated.

## Things I'm Working Towards

Here are the things I'm working on right now, as of Aug 2018.

### Performance

I follow a green/orange/red system.  If I haven't told you otherwise, you are in the green.

**Green**: You're doing good, great, exceptional.  There still might be areas of improvement, but you're getting the job done and working well with your team.

**Orange**: There are one or more things that, if not improved, are unsustainable.

**Red**: There is a significant problem that won't be tollerated for much longer.  You need to identify a series of steps, and a timeframe, to get it fixed.  We will talk about and agree on both of these.
